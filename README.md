So Ray J went straight to the radio station, the very next day, "Hey Fab, I'ma kill you"
Lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad)
Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you? I'm superhuman
Innovative and I'm made of rubber so that anythin' you say is ricochetin' off of me, and it'll glue to you and
I'm devastatin', more than ever demonstratin', how to give a mother- audience a feelin' like it's levitatin'
Never fadin' and I know the haters are forever waitin' for the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebratin'
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated, I make elevatin' music, you make elevator music
"Oh, he's too mainstream", well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
"It's not hip-hop, it's pop" 'cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc, throw on "Lose Yourself" and make 'em lose it
